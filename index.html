        <h1>Inclusive Hiring for People with Disabilities</h1>
        <p>
          From the very first days of our company, Microsoft has sought to
          enable individuals and organizations around the world to do great
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our Mission is to empower every person and every organization on the
          planet to achieve more. One of the ways we will fulfill this ambition
          is through an unwavering commitment to a diverse workforce and an
          inclusive culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are on a journey to leverage the strength of our diverse workforce
          through greater inclusion. Being inclusive is not something we simply
          do, but rather, it stands for who we are. In other words, where we are
          along our journey determines who we are as a company and gives meaning
          to the culture we are building at Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>
          The diversity of our workforce and inclusion of talented people from
          different backgrounds is the fuel that keeps the engines of innovation
          and growth running. This is essential to our long-term success. In
          order to build the best products for everyone, we need to have a
          diverse and inclusive workforce across all abilities. For example, in
          the case for autism, we know there is an untapped pool of talent with
          skills aligned to the work we are doing every day at Microsoft.
