          <h1>Inclusive Hiring for People with Disabilities</h1>
          <p>
            From the very first days of our company, Microsoft has sought to
            enable individuals and organizations around the world to do great
            things.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Mission is to empower every person and every organization on the
            planet to achieve more. One of the ways we will fulfill this
            ambition is through an unwavering commitment to a diverse workforce
            and an inclusive culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are on a journey to leverage the strength of our diverse
            workforce through greater inclusion. Being inclusive is not
            something we simply do, but rather, it stands for who we are. In
            other words, where we are along our journey determines who we are as
            a company and gives meaning to the culture we are building at
            Microsoft.
          </p>
          <p>
            The diversity of our workforce and inclusion of talented people from
            different backgrounds is the fuel that keeps the engines of
            innovation and growth running. This is essential to our long-term
            success. In order to build the best products for everyone, we need
            to have a diverse and inclusive workforce across all abilities. For
            example, in the case for autism, we know there is an untapped pool
            of talent with skills aligned to the work we are doing every day at
            Microsoft.
