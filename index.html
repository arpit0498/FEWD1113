            <h1>Inclusive Hiring for People with Disabilities</h1>
            <p>
              From the very first days of our company, Microsoft has sought to
              enable individuals and organizations around the world to do great
              things.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Mission is to empower every person and every organization on
              the planet to achieve more. One of the ways we will fulfill this
              ambition is through an unwavering commitment to a diverse
              workforce and an inclusive culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are on a journey to leverage the strength of our diverse
              workforce through greater inclusion. Being inclusive is not
              something we simply do, but rather, it stands for who we are. In
              other words, where we are along our journey determines who we are
              as a company and gives meaning to the culture we are building at
              Microsoft.
            </p>
            <p>
              The diversity of our workforce and inclusion of talented people
              from different backgrounds is the fuel that keeps the engines of
              innovation and growth running. This is essential to our long-term
              success. In order to build the best products for everyone, we need
              to have a diverse and inclusive workforce across all abilities.
              For example, in the case for autism, we know there is an untapped
              pool of talent with skills aligned to the work we are doing every
              day at Microsoft.
            </p>
